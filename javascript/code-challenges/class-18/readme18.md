``Approach & Efficiency``
Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a binaryTree as an argument.
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine weather or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both, and change the value of each of the nodes:
If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz” Return the binaryTree with its new values.
For explicitly-typed languages: Ensure your node values are of type Object, to hold either strings or integers.
